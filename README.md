# PyCharm IDE User Documentation

## About the Project

This user documentation was created to help new [**PyCharm**](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) users learn the basic features of the IDE. This was an assignment given to use during our time at BCIT's Computer Systems Technology program. We were tasked to create a documentation designed to assist the Term 1 students of our program.

This documentation informs users of the following:

- Creating a new project folder.
- Writing and running code.
- Debugging the code.
- Creating a GitHub repository.
- How to use the git controls.

## Our Collaboration Process

As this was an assignment for our COMM 2216 Business Communication 2 class, we would use our class time as a means to have a team meeting. During these times, we would update each other on our progress and discuss about the remaining tasks needed to be completed.

We also used Discord as a means of communicating with each other whenever we weren't in class. On Discord, we would update each other on the changes we have added to the project. This allowed us to always stay updated on the state of our progress. It also served as a place to ask each other for help whenever a problem occurred.

GitHub was also used in order for us to collaborate and work on the documentation together. Each of would work on separate files at a time. This made sure that we wouldn't have to deal with merging problems.

## Using Markdown and MkDocs

Before this project, we had only been slightly introduced to markdown, and we did not yet fully understand its basic features. Over the course of the project, we would have to learn how to use the basic syntax of markdown and how to style our documentation using it.

We also designed our documentation with the help of [**MkDocs**](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). MkDocs provided us with features that helped us further customize the appearance of our website documentation. From changing the font style and the overall theme of our website to a more ingenious way of navigating through sections, MkDocs allowed us to explore different ways to give our readers a better experience.

### MkDocs Admonitions

By using the admonitions feature MkDocs has provided us, we were able to help improve the experience of our readers.

## Conclusion

Working on this project allowed us to further understand the features PyCharm has to offer. It also helped as a review in how to work with the PyCharm IDE since we no longer user PyCharm as we have now moved on to learning Java.

This also helped us gain more skills by learning how to write and style text in markdown. It served as a great experience for us to learn how to use new things by ourselves.

Finally, we were able to further improve our writing skills. By creating a documentation designed for new users, we had to look through the eyes of our readers and help them better understand our writing. This helped us get a better understanding of writing in the language of the reader.
