## Overview

In this section, you will be creating your first project in PyCharm and write your first Python Code. You will also learn how to change your preference settings to improve your coding experience.

## Creating a Project

We will start out by opening up Pycharm and creating a folder for our Python project.

1. Open up Pycharm and Click on New Project.

    You have successfully created a new project folder. Your project should now pop up in a new window.

## Writing Python Code

After successfully making a project folder in Pycharm, we can now write and run our first Python code.

1. Make a new Python file by right clicking on your project folder.

After naming your file, you should now be able to see your new Python file under your project folder.

2. Write out your first Python code into the code window.

Let's start by printing "Hello World" into the terminal. Copy this code ```print("Hello World)``` and paste it into your window.

3. Click on the green play button at the top right of your window.

## Editing Preference Settings

Now, you will learn how to change your settings according to your preferences in order to give yourself a better coding experience.

1. Open up your settings by navigating to the File dropdown at the top left of your window.

Changing the 'Line height' will allow you to edit the spacing between your lines. Opening up the 'Font' dropdown will allow you to view all the available fonts in Pycharm.

3. Navigate to Python in the Code Style dropdown.
