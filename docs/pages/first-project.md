## Overview

In this section, you will be introduced to the basics of PyCharm such as creating your first project and knowing how to write and run your code. You will also learn how to navigate through the settings to change the way your code looks, and as a result, improving your coding experience.

## Creating a Project

We will start out by opening up Pycharm and creating a folder for our Python project.

1. Open up Pycharm and Click on 'New Project'.

    You have successfully created a new project folder. Your project should now pop up in a new window.

## Writing Python Code

After successfully making a project folder in Pycharm, we can now write and run our first Python code.

1. Make a new Python file by right clicking on your project folder.

After naming your file, you should now be able to see your new Python file under your project folder.

2. Copy this code and paste it onto your IDE.

    ``` py
    print("Hello World")
    ```

        Alternatively, you can also use Shift+F10 as a shortcut to run your code.

After running your code, a terminal should pop up at the bottom of your window with your output.

!!! success
    Congratulations, you have written your first Python code! You are now a programmer!

## Editing Preference Settings

Now, you will learn how to change your settings according to your preferences in order to give yourself a better coding experience.

1. Open up your settings by navigating to the File dropdown at the top left of your window.
